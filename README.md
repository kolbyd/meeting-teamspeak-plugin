# Teamspeak Meeting Plugin

Server members bringing you down, but you're too lazy to kick them all in time? Look no further! With 2 clicks, every member in your channel will be sent back to the lobby!

Right-click on any member or channel, and kick them all in preparation of your 4 o'clock meeting in seconds.

## Installing

Open the latest workflow run [here](https://github.com/kolbyd/meeting-teamspeak-plugin/actions/workflows/msbuild.yml). At the bottom, you should see 2 artifacts (x86 for 32-bit systems, and x64 for 64-bit systems). Download the one that matches your platform.

From there, add the file to your TS3 plugins folder. This can be found at `%AppData\TS3Client\plugins\`. Then, you can run your TeamSpeak Client to enable the plugin (under 'Addons').

Woila! Right-click and kick people at ease, with ease-of-mind.
